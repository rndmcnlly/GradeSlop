I'm a self-service tool intended to let you apply natural language text generation prompts to student submission data pulled from Canvas. I'm intended to be hosted on the [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).

### How to run it on your own machine

1. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```
   $ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
